It's not uncommon for workspace administrators to [disable the use of PATs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/access-control/tokens.html#enable-or-disable-personal-access-token-authentication-for-the-workspace).\n\nIf you are unable to create a PAT you are still able to connect to Databricks but you'll need to use OAuth (either [M2M](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html) or [U2M](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-u2m.html)).\n\nUser-to-machine (U2M) is typically what you'd want to use. Good news, [the Databricks ODBC driver supports both since `2.7.5`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/odbc/authentication.html#oauth-20-tokens).\n\n## U2M Example\n\n::: callout-note\nOAuth U2M or OAuth 2.0 browser-based authentication works only with applications that run locally. It does not work with server-based or cloud-based applications.\n:::\n\nWhen running this code you should be prompted to login to the workspace or you'll see a window that says \"success\". You can close the window and continue working in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(odbc)\nlibrary(DBI)\n\ncon <- DBI::dbConnect(\n  drv = odbc::databricks(), #<1>\n  httpPath = \"/sql/1.0/warehouses/<warehouse-id>\", #<2>\n  workspace = \"<workspace-name>.cloud.databricks.com\", #<3>\n  authMech = 11, #<4>\n  auth_flow = 2 #<4>\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  `{odbc}` recently added [`odbc::databricks()`](https://odbc.r-dbi.org/reference/databricks.html) to simplify connecting to Databricks ([requires version `>=1.4.0`](https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc/blob/main/NEWS.md#odbc-140))\n\n2.  The [`httpPath`](https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/compute-details.html) can be found in the 'Connection Details' tab of a SQL warehouse\n\n3.  `workspace` refers to the workspace URL, also found in 'Connection Details' tab as 'Server hostname'\n\n4.  The [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/odbc/authentication.html#oauth-user-to-machine-u2m-authentication) mention setting `AuthMech` to `11` and `Auth_Flow` to `2`\n",
