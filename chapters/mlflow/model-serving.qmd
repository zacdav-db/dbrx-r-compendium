# Model Serving

## Under Development

[Model serving on Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html) is well documented for Python. It is a common misconception that you cannot serve R models on Databricks, you can!

The amount of effort is going to depend heavily on the model flavour. In most occasions the amount of effort is not worth it - but that decision is not mine to make, I will show you how and you can decide for yourself.
