    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 Unity Catalog Model Requirements\nFor models to be logged into Unity Catalog they must have a model signature. The Model signature defines the schema for model inputs/outputs.\nTypically when using python this would be inferred via model input examples. Input examples are optional but strongly recommended.\nThe documentation discusses signature enforcement, currently this isn’t implemented for R. Therefore you can decide if the signature is a dummy value for the sake of moving forward, or correct to clearly communicate the behaviour of the model.\nSo, let’s look at the existing code to log models in the crate flavour:\nmlflow_save_model.crate &lt;- function(model, path, model_spec=list(), ...) {\n1  if (dir.exists(path)) unlink(path, recursive = TRUE)\n  dir.create(path)\n\n2  serialized &lt;- serialize(model, NULL)\n\n3  saveRDS(\n    serialized,\n    file.path(path, \"crate.bin\")\n  )\n\n4  model_spec$flavors &lt;- append(model_spec$flavors, list(\n    crate = list(\n      version = \"0.1.0\",\n      model = \"crate.bin\"\n    )\n  ))\n  mlflow_write_model_spec(path, model_spec)\n  model_spec\n}\n\n\n1\n\nCreate the directory to save the model if it doesn’t exist, if it does, empty it\n\n2\n\nSerialise the model, which is an object of class crate (from {carrier} package)\n\n3\n\nSave the serialised model via saveRDS to the directory as crate.bin\n\n4\n\nDefine the model specification, this contains metadata required ensure reproducibility. In this case it’s only specifying a version and what file the model can be found within.\nThe missing puzzle piece is the definition of a signature. Instead of explicitly adding code to the crate flavour itself, we’ll take advantage of the model_spec parameter.\nThat means we can focus on mlflow::mlflow_log_model directly, we’d need to adjust the code as follows:\n1mlflow_log_model &lt;- function(model, artifact_path, signature, ...) {\n  \n  temp_path &lt;- fs::path_temp(artifact_path)\n  \n  model_spec &lt;- mlflow_save_model(\n    model, path = temp_path,\n2    model_spec = list(\n      utc_time_created = mlflow_timestamp(),\n      run_id = mlflow_get_active_run_id_or_start_run(),\n      artifact_path = artifact_path,\n      flavors = list(),\n      signature = signature\n    ),\n  ...)\n  \n  res &lt;- mlflow_log_artifact(path = temp_path, artifact_path = artifact_path)\n  \n  tryCatch({\n    mlflow:::mlflow_record_logged_model(model_spec)\n  },\n  error = function(e) {\n    warning(\n      paste(\"Logging model metadata to the tracking server has failed, possibly due to older\",\n            \"server version. The model artifacts have been logged successfully.\",\n            \"In addition to exporting model artifacts, MLflow clients 1.7.0 and above\",\n            \"attempt to record model metadata to the  tracking store. If logging to a\",\n            \"mlflow server via REST, consider  upgrading the server version to MLflow\",\n            \"1.7.0 or above.\", sep=\" \")\n    )\n  })\n  res\n}\n\n\n1\n\nAdd a new parameter signature\n\n2\n\nPropagate signature to the model_spec parameter when invoking mlflow::mlflow_save_model\nBenefit of this method is that all model flavors will inherit the capability to log a signature.",

The easiest way to overcome this is to simply register the run via python.\nFor example:\n\nimport mlflow\nmlflow.set_registry_uri(\"databricks-uc\")\n\ncatalog = \"main\"\nschema = \"default\"\nmodel_name = \"my_model\"\n1run_uri = \"runs:/&lt;run_id&gt;/model\"\n\nmlflow.register_model(run_uri, f\"{catalog}.{schema}.{model_name}\")\n\n\n1\n\nYou’ll need to either get the run_uri programmatically or copy it manually\n\n\n\n\nTo do this with R you’ll need to make a series of requests to Unity Catalog endpoints for registering model, the specific steps are:\n\n(Optional) Create a new model in Unity Catalog\n\nPOST request on /api/2.0/mlflow/unity-catalog/registered-models/create\n\nname: 3 tiered namespace (e.g. main.default.my_model)\n\n\nCreate a version for the model\n\nPOST request on /api/2.0/mlflow/unity-catalog/model-versions/create\n\nname: 3 tiered namespace (e.g. main.default.my_model)\nsource: URI indicating the location of the model artifacts\nrun_id: run_id from tracking server that generated the model\nrun_tracking_server_id: Workspace ID of run that generated the model\n\nThis will return storage_location and version\n\nCopy model artifacts\n\nNeed to copy the artifacts to storage_location from step (2)\n\nFinalise the model version\n\nPOST request on /api/2.0/mlflow/unity-catalog/model-versions/finalize\n\nname: 3 tiered namespace (e.g. main.default.my_model)\nversion: version returned from step (2)\n\n\n\nIt’s considerably easier to just use Python to register the model at this time.",

    "text": "4.3 Adjusting .libPaths()\n\n4.3.1 Ordering\nGiven that .libPaths() can return 6 values in a notebook you might wonder if there a “best” position to add your new volume path(s) to, that will depend on how you want packages to behave.\nA safe default is to add a path after the cluster libraries location (currently 3rd), this will make it appear as if the Databricks Runtime has been extended to include packages in the volume path(s).\nAlternatively you could add it after the first path and all users will still have the notebook scope package behaviour by default but cluster libraries may not load if they appear in the earlier paths under a different version.\nIt will be up to you to decide what works best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI don’t recommend pre-pending .libPaths() with volume paths as packages will attempt to install to the first value and you cannot directly install packages to a volume path (due to volumes being backed onto cloud storage). This is why the example for persisting copies after installation.\n\n\nAn example of adjusting .libPaths() looks like:\n\nvolume_pkgs &lt;- \"/Volumes/&lt;catalog&gt;/&lt;schema&gt;/&lt;volume&gt;/my_packages\"\n.libPaths(new = append(.libPaths(), volume_pkgs, after = 3))\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Helpful Functions\nThe examples can be used to build a set of functions to make this easier.\nCopying a Package\n\ncopy_package &lt;- function(name, destination) {\n  package_loc &lt;- find.package(name)\n  file.copy(from = package_loc, to = destination, recursive = TRUE)\n}\n\n# e.g. move {ggplot2} to volume\ncopy_package(\"ggplot2\", \"/Volumes/&lt;catalog&gt;/&lt;schema&gt;/&lt;volume&gt;/my_packages\")\n\nAlter .libPaths()\n\nadd_lib_paths &lt;- function(path, after, version = FALSE) {\n1  if (version) {\n    rver &lt;- getRversion()\n    lib_path &lt;- file.path(path, rver)\n  } else {\n    lib_path &lt;- file.path(path)\n  }\n\n  # ensure directory exists\n  if (!file.exists(lib_path)) {\n    dir.create(lib_path, recursive = TRUE)\n  }\n\n  lib_path &lt;- normalizePath(lib_path, \"/\")\n\n  message(\"primary package path is now \", lib_path)\n  .libPaths(new = append(.libPaths(), lib_path, after = after))\n  lib_path\n}\n\n\n1\n\nAllows specifying version as TRUE or FALSE to suffix the supplied path with the current R version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Avoiding Repetition\nTo avoid manually adjusting .libPaths() every notebook you can craft an init script or set environment variables, depending on the desired outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIn practice this interferes with how Databricks sets up the environment, validate any changes thoroughly before rolling out to users.\n\n\n\n4.3.3.1 Init Script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis example appends to the existing Renviron.site file to ensure any settings defined as part of runtime are preserved.\nThe last two lines of the script are setting R_LIBS_SITE and R_LIBS_USER.

    "section": "2.2 Why is this so simple?",
    "text": "2.2 Why is this so simple?\nA natural question is “why did I have to go through all the pain to register the model, but loading just works?”\nThe quick answer is that {mlflow} doesn’t have internal consistency with how it operates, some methods use direct API calls (e.g. registration) and where as others defer to the mlflow CLI via a system call (e.g. loading).\n\n2.2.1 The details\nAs of version 2.20.1 we can split {mlflow} into those that directly invokes mlflow’s REST API’s via R, or the mlflow CLI.\n\nWhich functions use REST or CLI clients within {mlflow}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvokes REST Client\nInvokes CLI Client\n\n\n\n\nNot relevant to Unity Catalog\n(e.g. experiment tracking related)\nmlflow_create_experiment()\nmlflow_search_experiments()\nmlflow_set_experiment_tag()\nmlflow_get_experiment()\nmlflow_delete_experiment()\nmlflow_delete_experiment()\nmlflow_rename_experiment()\nmlflow_transition_model_version_stage()\nmlflow_record_logged_model()\n\nmlflow_set_model_version_tag()\nmlflow_search_registered_models()\n\n\n\nRelevant to Unity Catalog\n(e.g. model registry)\nmlflow_create_registered_model()\nmlflow_get_registered_model()\nmlflow_rename_registered_model()\nmlflow_update_registered_model()\nmlflow_delete_registered_model()\nmlflow_get_latest_versions()\nmlflow_create_model_version()\nmlflow_get_model_version()\nmlflow_update_model_version()\nmlflow_log_model()*\nmlflow_download_artifacts_from_uri()\nmlflow_download_artifacts()\nmlflow_log_artifact()\nmlflow_load_model()\n\n\n\nmlflow_load_model() calls mlflow_download_artifacts_from_uri(), which in turn uses the CLI directly. The CLI was updated to support Unity Catalog, hence why it ‘just works’ and the functions inherit Unity Catalog compatibility without code changes.\nYou may notice mlflow_log_model() has an asterix, that is because it uniquely calls CLI client (mlflow_log_artifact()) and REST client (mlflow_record_logged_model()), I’ve placed it in the REST column for now.\nThis is part of the problem discussed previously in Section 1.2.3. Unfortunately the CLI doesn’t expose the model registry methods required to support registering models to Unity Catalog, these need to be implemented as part of the REST client in {mlflow}.",

Other functions that operate on a set of rows would behave differently (e.g. summary()).\n\n\n\n\nSparkR::spark.lapply() is unique in that it applies to lists in R, as opposed to DataFrames. There is no exact equivalent in {sparklyr}, but using spark_apply() with a DataFrame with unique IDs and grouping it by ID will behave similarly in many cases, or, more creative functions that operate on a row-wise basis.\nSparkR\n\n# define a list of integers\nnumbers &lt;- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# define a function to apply\nsquare &lt;- function(x) {\n  x * x\n}\n\n# apply the function over list using spark\nspark.lapply(numbers, square)\n\nsparklyr\n\n# create a spark DataFrame of given length\nsdf &lt;- sdf_len(sc, 5, repartition = 1)\n\n# apply function to each partition of data.frame\n1spark_apply(sdf, f = nrow)\n\n# apply function to each row (option 1)\n2spark_apply(sdf, f = nrow, group_by = \"id\")\n\n# apply function to each row (option 2)\n3row_func &lt;- function(df) {\n  df |&gt;\n    dplyr::rowwise() |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(x = id * 2)\n}\nspark_apply(sdf, f = row_func)\n\n\n1\n\nspark_apply() defaults to processing data based on number of partitions, in this case it will return a single row as due to repartition = 1.\n\n2\n\nTo force behaviour like spark.lapply() you can create a DataFrame with N rows and force grouping with group_by set to a unique row identifier (in this case it’s the id column automatically generated by sdf_len()). This will return N rows.\n\n3\n\nThis requires writing a function that operates across rows of a data.frame, in some occassions this may be faster relative to (2). Specifying group_by in optional for this example. This example does not require rowwise(), but is just to illustrate one method to force computations to be for every row. Your function should take care to import required packages, etc.",

This makes it straightforward for those familiar with Spark’s other language interfaces - Scala and Python. However, this may be less intuitive for R users accustomed to the tidyverse.\nIn contrast, {sparklyr} is developed and maintained by Posit PBC with a focus on providing a more R-friendly experience. It leverages {dplyr} syntax, which is highly familiar to users of the {tidyverse}, enabling them to interact with Spark DataFrames using R-native verbs like select(), filter(), and mutate(). This makes {sparklyr} easier to learn for R users, especially those who are not familiar with Spark’s native API.",

This helps when reading the data multiple times - sometimes its worth setting to FALSE if data is read as one-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Creating Views\nSparkR\n\n# create temporary view\ncreateOrReplaceTempView(mtcars_df, \"mtcars_tmp_view\")\n\nsparklyr\n\n# direct equivlent from SparkR requires `invoke`\n# usually redundant given `copy_to` already creates a temp view\nspark_dataframe(mtcars_tbl) |&gt;\n  invoke(\"createOrReplaceTempView\", \"mtcars_tmp_view\")\n\n\n\n7.3.4 Writing Data\nSparkR\n\n# save SparkDataFrame to Unity Catalog\nsaveAsTable(\n  mtcars_df,\n  tableName = \"&lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\",\n  mode = \"overwrite\"\n)\n\n# save DataFrame using delta format to local filesystem\nwrite.df(\n  mtcars_df,\n  path = \"file:/&lt;path/to/save/delta/mtcars&gt;\",\n1  source = \"delta\",\n  mode = \"overwrite\"\n)\n\n\n1\n\nwrite.df() supports other formats via source parameter\n\n\n\n\nsparklyr\n\n# save tbl_spark to Unity Catalog\nspark_write_table(\n  mtcars_tbl,\n  name = \"&lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\",\n  mode = \"overwrite\"\n)\n\n# save tbl_spark using delta format to local filesystem\nspark_write_delta(\n  mtcars_tbl,\n  path = \"file:/&lt;path/to/save/delta/mtcars&gt;\",\n  mode = \"overwrite\"\n)\n\n# Using {DBI}\nlibrary(DBI)\ndbWriteTable(\n  sc,\n  value = mtcars_tbl,\n  name = \"&lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\",\n  overwrite = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n7.3.5 Reading Data\nSparkR\n\n# load Unity Catalog table as SparkDataFrame\ntableToDF(\"&lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\")\n\n# load csv file into SparkDataFrame\nread.df(\n  path = \"file:/&lt;path/to/read/csv/data.csv&gt;\",\n  source = \"csv\",\n  header = TRUE,\n  inferSchema = TRUE\n)\n\n# load delta from local filesystem as SparkDataFrame\nread.df(\n  path = \"file:/&lt;path/to/read/delta/mtcars&gt;\",\n  source = \"delta\"\n)\n\n# load data from a table using SQL\n# recommended to use `tableToDF`\nsql(\"SELECT * FROM &lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\")\n\nsparklyr\n\n# currently has an issue if using Unity Catalog\n# recommend using `tbl` (example below)\nspark_read_table(sc, \"&lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\", memory = FALSE)\n\n# load table from Unity Catalog with {dplyr}\ntbl(sc, \"&lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\")\n\n# or using `in_catalog`\ntbl(sc, in_catalog(\"&lt;catalog&gt;\", \"&lt;schema&gt;\", \"&lt;table&gt;\"))\n\n# load csv from local filesystem as tbl_spark\nspark_read_csv(\n  sc,\n  name = \"mtcars_csv\",\n  path = \"file:/&lt;path/to/delta/mtcars&gt;\",\n  header = TRUE,\n  infer_schema = TRUE\n)\n\n# load delta from local filesystem as tbl_spark\nspark_read_delta(\n  sc,\n  name = \"mtcars_delta\",\n  path = \"file:/tmp/test/sparklyr1\"\n)\n\n# using SQL\nsdf_sql(sc, \"SELECT * FROM &lt;catalog&gt;.&lt;schema&gt;.&lt;table&gt;\")",

In general, only collect small amounts of data back to R data frames or the Spark driver will run out of memory, crashing your script (and you want to use Spark to accelerate workloads as much as possible!).\nTo prevent out of memory errors, {SparkR} has built-in optimizations in Databricks Runtime that help collect data or execute user-defined functions (which also require collecting data to workers).
